## Overview

### The challenge

I was able to do the following:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission - I used Javascript for this. 
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader - I used alerts in Javascript to achieve this. 
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learnt how to use Javascript to create an alert for a particular section of the site. 

### Continued development

In future projects, I hope to be able to use the RandomColor function to see how it would look like in my contact form projects.
